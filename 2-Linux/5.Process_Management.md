# üß† Process Management in Linux ‚Äî Road to DevOps



---

## üìò Introduction

In Linux, **process management** is a critical part of system administration and DevOps.  
A **process** is simply a running instance of a program. Understanding how to monitor, control, and manage processes ensures efficient resource usage and system stability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Processes

| Type | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Foreground Process** | Runs directly from the terminal and occupies it until execution is complete. |
| **Background Process** | Runs in the background allowing the terminal to be free for other commands. |
| **Daemon Process** | System-level background processes (e.g., `sshd`, `cron`). |
| **Zombie Process** | Completed but not yet removed from the process table. |
| **Orphan Process** | A child process whose parent has been terminated. |

## üîç Viewing Processes

| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ps` | Displays currently running processes. |
| `ps -ef` | Shows all processes in full format. |
| `top` | Real-time view of system processes and CPU/memory usage. |
| `htop` | Interactive version of `top` (install separately). |
| `pidof <process>` | Shows process ID (PID) of a running program. |
| `pgrep <name>` | Finds processes by name. |

## üß© Managing Processes

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting & Stopping
```bash
# Start a process
./script.sh

# Run a process in background
./script.sh &

# Stop a process using its PID
kill <PID>

# Force kill (if not responding)
kill -9 <PID>

# Bring background process to foreground
fg %1

# Suspend (pause) a process
Ctrl + Z

# Resume a suspended process
bg %1
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

üß† Process Priorities

Each process has a priority that determines how much CPU time it gets

nice -n <value> command  -- Start process with a specific priority (-20 to 19;  
lower = higher priority).

renice <value> -p <PID> -- Change priority of an existing process.

Example-----
nice -n 10 ./script.sh       # Low priority
renice -5 -p 1234            # Increase priority of PID 1234
