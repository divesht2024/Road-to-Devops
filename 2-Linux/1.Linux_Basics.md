ðŸ”¹What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on UNIX. It acts as a bridge between computer hardware and users, managing hardware resources and running applications efficiently.


ðŸ”¹Why Linux?
Open Source: Anyone can use, modify, and distribute it freely.

Stable & Secure: Rarely crashes and provides strong user permissions and security mechanisms.

Customizable: You can modify every part of it.

Used Everywhere: From servers, mobile devices (Android), and embedded systems to supercomputers.

Free to Use: No licensing cost like Windows.




ðŸ”¹ Components of Linux

Kernel:
The core of the operating system. It manages CPU, memory, and devices.

Types of Kernels: Monolithic, Microkernel, Hybrid.

Shell:
Interface between the user and the kernel. It interprets user commands and passes them to the system.

System Libraries:
Special programs that allow applications to access kernel features.

System Utilities:
Tools that perform individual, specialized management tasks (e.g., file management, monitoring).

|        Kernel        |
+----------------------+
|       Hardware       |
+----------------------+

Explanation:

User Applications â€“ Programs like browsers, editors, etc.

Shell â€“ Command interpreter.

Kernel â€“ Manages hardware, processes, and memory.

Hardware â€“ Physical components like CPU, RAM, Disk.

Linux Distributions (Distros)

A Linux distribution combines the Linux kernel with software packages and a package manager.

Popular Distros:

Ubuntu (User-friendly)

Debian (Stable base)

Fedora (Developer-focused)

CentOS / Rocky Linux (Enterprise use)

Kali Linux (Security testing)

Linux Boot Process

BIOS/UEFI: Performs hardware checks and loads the bootloader.

Bootloader (e.g., GRUB): Loads the Linux kernel into memory.

Kernel Initialization: Detects hardware and mounts the root filesystem.

Init/Systemd: Starts system services and background processes.

Login Prompt: User logs into the shell or GUI.



ðŸ”¹ Linux File System Structure

| Directory | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root directory (base of Linux)     |
| `/bin`    | Essential binary programs          |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries for admin tasks    |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files                |
| `/home`   | User home directories              |
| `/var`    | Variable files (logs, mail, cache) |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files                    |
| `/usr`    | User programs and data             |
| `/lib`    | Libraries needed by binaries       |
| `/boot`   | Boot files like kernel & GRUB      |
| `/dev`    | Device files                       |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount points             |
| `/opt`    | Optional software                  |
| `/proc`   | Process info (virtual filesystem)  |
| `/run`    | Runtime process data               |
| `/srv`    | Data for services (like FTP, HTTP) |

ðŸ”¹ Linux File Types

Regular files â€“ text, images, executables.

Directories â€“ contain other files.

Symbolic links â€“ shortcuts or references to other files.

Device files â€“ represent hardware (in /dev).

Sockets & Pipes â€“ enable communication between processes.


ðŸ”¹ Users and Groups

User: Each person using the system.

Group: Collection of users with shared permissions.

Root User: Superuser with all permissions.

Normal User: Limited access.

ðŸ”¹Every file in Linux has:

Owner (User who created it)

Group (Group assigned to it)

Others (Everyone else)

ðŸ”¹ File Permissions

Every file or directory has read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions.

| Permission | For Files        | For Directories      |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| **r**      | Can read content | Can list contents    |
| **w**      | Can modify       | Can add/remove files |
| **x**      | Can execute      | Can enter directory  |


ðŸ”¹ Process Management

A process is a running instance of a program.

Foreground Process: Runs interactively with the terminal.

Background Process: Runs without user interaction.

Daemon: Background service (e.g., sshd, cron).

Each process has:

PID (Process ID)

Parent Process (PPID)


ðŸ”¹ Package Management

Used to install, update, and remove software.

Debian-based (Ubuntu): Uses .deb packages with APT.

Red Hat-based (Fedora/CentOS): Uses .rpm packages with YUM or DNF.


ðŸ”¹ Environment Variables

They store configuration data for shell and processes.
Examples:

PATH â€“ Locations to search for executables

HOME â€“ Userâ€™s home directory

USER â€“ Current logged-in user



ðŸ”¹ Shell Types

Common shells:

bash (Bourne Again Shell)

sh

zsh

ksh

The shell interprets commands and allows scripting (automation).



ðŸ”¹ Input, Output, and Redirection

Standard Input (stdin): Input to a program.

Standard Output (stdout): Normal program output.

Standard Error (stderr): Error messages.
These can be redirected to files or other commands.



ðŸ”¹ Links in Linux

Hard Link: Another name for a file; both share the same data.

Soft Link (Symbolic Link): Shortcut pointing to another file.



ðŸ”¹ Networking Basics in Linux

Linux can act as a server or client.

Each system has an IP address and hostname.

Configuration files are often in /etc/network/ or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.

Common network services: SSH, FTP, DNS, HTTP.


ðŸ”¹ Logging System

System logs store messages and errors for troubleshooting.

Logs are in /var/log/ directory.

Common logs:

/var/log/syslog

/var/log/auth.log

/var/log/messages


ðŸ”¹ Tasks & Scheduling

Linux uses cron jobs and at jobs to automate tasks.

cron: For recurring tasks.

at: For one-time scheduled tasks.


ðŸ”¹ Disk Management

Everything in Linux is a file, including disks.

Mounting: Making a storage device accessible.

Disk info can be found in /etc/fstab and /proc/mounts.


ðŸ”¹ Swap Space

Swap acts as virtual memory on the hard disk when physical RAM is full.


ðŸ”¹ System Security Basics

Use of file permissions.

sudo for administrative commands.

Firewall (ufw / firewalld) to control traffic.

SELinux/AppArmor for process-level security.
