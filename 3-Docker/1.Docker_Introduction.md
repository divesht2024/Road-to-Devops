## Introduction to Docker

**Docker** is an open-source platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistent execution across environments.

**Key Features:**
- Lightweight and fast compared to virtual machines.
- Consistent environment for development, testing, and production.
- Easy to scale applications with containers.
- Supports microservices architecture.

**Why Docker?**
- Solves the “It works on my machine” problem.
- Simplifies software deployment.
- Efficient resource usage and faster startup time.
