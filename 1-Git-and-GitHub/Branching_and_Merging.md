# 🌿 Branching and Merging in Git

Branching and merging are powerful features in Git that make it easy to manage multiple lines of development.  
They allow developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the main codebase.

---

## 🧩 What is a Branch?

A **branch** in Git is a pointer to a specific commit.  
Think of it as a separate workspace or version of your project where you can safely make changes.

### 🔸 Why Branches Are Important
- Enables multiple people to work on the same project.
- Allows experimentation without affecting the main code.
- Simplifies testing and debugging.
- Helps organize development using workflows.

---

## 🌱 Creating and Managing Branches

### Create a New Branch
```bash
git branch feature-login
```

### Switch to the Branch
```bash
git checkout feature-login
```

Or do both at once:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
```

### View All Branches
```bash
git branch
```

### Delete a Branch
After merging:
```bash
git branch -d feature-login
```
Force delete (if not merged):
```bash
git branch -D feature-login
```

---

## 🧭 Understanding the Default Branch

The default branch is usually named `main` (previously `master`).

- **main** → stable production-ready code.  
- **develop** → integration branch where new features are merged before going to main.

---

## 🌿 Common Branch Types and Their Purpose

| Branch Type | Purpose | Example Name |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **main / master** | Contains stable and production-ready code. | `main` |
| **develop** | Used for integration of all features. | `develop` |
| **feature branch** | Used to build or test a new feature. | `feature/login-page` |
| **release branch** | Used to prepare a new release version. | `release/v1.0.0` |
| **hotfix branch** | Used to fix urgent issues in production. | `hotfix/bug-101` |

---

## 🔁 Merging Branches

Merging brings the changes from one branch into another.

### Example: Merging `feature-login` into `main`
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch into main
git merge feature-login
```

If there are no conflicts, Git performs a **fast-forward merge** and automatically integrates the changes.

---

## ⚙️ Types of Merges

### 1. **Fast-Forward Merge**
Happens when the target branch has not diverged.
```bash
git merge feature-login
```
✅ Simple, keeps history clean.  
🚫 Does not show explicit merge commits.

---

### 2. **Three-Way Merge (No Fast Forward)**
When branches diverge (both have new commits), Git creates a merge commit.
```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-login
```
✅ Keeps full history of when merges occurred.  
Useful in team environments.

---

## ⚔️ Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when changes in two branches affect the same lines of code.

### How to Resolve Merge Conflicts
1. Open the conflicting file:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Code from current branch
   =======
   Code from branch being merged
   >>>>>>> feature-login
   ```
2. Edit manually to choose which code to keep.
3. Add the resolved file:
   ```bash
   git add <filename>
   ```
4. Commit after resolving:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   ```

---

## 🧪 Example Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature-login

# Step 2: Work and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added login page"

# Step 3: Switch to develop/main branch
git checkout main

# Step 4: Merge the feature branch
git merge feature-login

# Step 5: Delete the merged branch
git branch -d feature-login
```

---

## 🧰 Advanced Merging Techniques

### Merge a Specific Commit (Cherry-Pick)
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
Used to apply a single commit from another branch.

### Merge Without Committing
```bash
git merge --no-commit --no-ff feature-login
```
Lets you review changes before committing.

---

## 🚀 Rebasing vs Merging (Quick Comparison)

| Command | Purpose | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| `git merge` | Combines history | Preserves commit history | Can be messy |
| `git rebase` | Moves commits to new base | Creates linear history | Can rewrite history |

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout feature-login
git rebase main
```

---

## 🌐 Merging Remote Branches

### Fetch and Merge Remote Branch
```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

### Merge a Remote Feature Branch
```bash
git pull origin feature-login
```

---

## 🧩 Visual Representation (Markdown Diagram)

```text
main
 |
 |----o----o----o----------o (main)
       \
        o----o----o (feature-login)
```

After merging:
```text
main
 |
 |----o----o----o----o----o (merged feature)
```

---

## 🧠 Best Practices for Branching and Merging

1. **Create branches for every feature or fix.**
2. **Keep branches small and focused.**
3. **Pull latest changes before merging.**
4. **Use meaningful branch names** (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `release/`).
5. **Always test before merging into main.**
6. **Avoid long-lived branches.**
7. **Use pull requests (PRs)** in GitHub for better collaboration.
8. **Resolve conflicts carefully and test again after merge.**
9. **Delete merged branches** to keep the repo clean.

## 🧭 Git Commands Cheat Sheet (Branching & Merging)

| Task | Command |
|------|----------|
| Create a branch | `git branch <branch-name>` |
| Switch to branch | `git checkout <branch-name>` |
| Create & switch | `git checkout -b <branch-name>` |
| Merge branches | `git merge <branch-name>` |
| Delete branch | `git branch -d <branch-name>` |
| View all branches | `git branch` |
| Merge without fast-forward | `git merge --no-ff <branch-name>` |
| Abort a merge | `git merge --abort` |
| View merge history | `git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all` |

---

## 🧩 Summary

Branching and merging are the heart of Git-based workflows.  
They:
- Make collaboration smoother,  
- Keep production code safe,  
- Allow parallel development,  
- And provide flexibility in version control.

By mastering branching and merging, you gain full control over your project’s history — a vital skill for any **DevOps Engineer**.
